Project Repostory space:

The static content should be put in the $TRAC_ENV/htdocs folder, and is accessed by URLs like <project_URL>/chrome/site/.... or under the vhost webroot folder (ie /var/www/sites/repos/) don't forget to set up your yum and tsunami/flatfile repositories in there as well.

Example: given a $TRAC_ENV/htdocs/software-0.1.tar.gz file, the corresponding relative URL would be /<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz, which in turn can be written using the relative link syntax in the Wiki: [/<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz]
